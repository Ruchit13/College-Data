# Usage of Kmeans and Hierarchical Clustering

## K-Means
1.Kmeans automatically handles the random initialisation trap with k-means ++ 
2.Elbow Method is used to decide the optimal number of clusters

## Hierarchical Clustering 
1. Agglomerative Clustering is used 
2. Dendograms decide the optimal number of clusters
 
### Accuracy b/w two clustering algorithms
The accuracy is decided via confusion matrix and classification report
